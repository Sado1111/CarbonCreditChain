# Carbon Credit NFT Smart Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a **Carbon Credit NFT Marketplace**, providing a blockchain-based solution for managing carbon credits. It is designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient issuance, transfer, and retirement of carbon credit NFTs, supporting sustainability efforts and carbon offset programs.

---

## Features

### **Core Functionalities**
- **Minting**: 
  - Allows contract owners to mint individual or batch carbon credits.
- **Metadata**: 
  - Associates each token with a URI for external resources.
- **Ownership Tracking**: 
  - Securely manages token ownership, enabling safe transfers.
- **Burning**: 
  - Supports retiring (burning) credits, ensuring they are not reused.

### **Validation and Integrity**
- Enforces proper URI format for metadata.
- Limits batch size to prevent excessive minting in a single operation.

---

## Security Measures
- **Owner-Restricted Minting**: Only the contract owner can issue carbon credits.
- **Burn Integrity**: Prevents actions on credits that have been retired.
- **Access Validation**: Ensures only token owners can perform specific operations.

---

## Intended Use Cases
1. **Carbon Offset Programs**: Tokenize and manage carbon offset credits.
2. **Environmental Marketplaces**: Enable secure trading of carbon credits.
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Ensure transparent management and retirement of credits.
